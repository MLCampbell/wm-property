                    <p>6.3 We will retain your personal data as follows:<br>
                        (a) All personal data categories listed previously in this policy document will be retained for

                    <h2 class="privacy-sub-header">8. Your rights</h2>
                    <p>8.1 In this Section 8, we have summarised the rights that you have under data protection law.
                        Some of the rights are complex, and not all of the details have been included in our summaries.
                        Accordingly, you should read the relevant laws and guidance from the regulatory authorities for
                        a full explanation of these rights.</p>
                    <p>8.2 Your principal rights under data protection law are:<br>
                        (a) the right to access;<br>
                        (b) the right to rectification;<br>
                        (c) the right to erasure;<br>
                        (d) the right to restrict processing;<br>
                        (e) the right to object to processing;<br>
                        (f) the right to data portability;<br>
                        (g) the right to complain to a supervisory authority; and<br>
                        (h) the right to withdraw consent.</p>
                    <p>8.3 You have the right to confirmation as to whether or not we process your personal data and,
                        where we do, access to the personal data, together with certain additional information. That
                        additional information includes details of the purposes of the processing, the categories of
                        personal data concerned and the recipients of the personal data. Providing the rights and
                        freedoms of others are not affected, we will supply to you a copy of your personal data. The
                        first copy will be provided free of charge, but additional copies may be subject to a reasonable
                        fee. You can access your personal data by contacting us through the website's contact form.</p>
                    <p>8.4 You have the right to have any inaccurate personal data about you rectified and, taking into
                        account the purposes of the processing, to have any incomplete personal data about you
                        completed.</p>
                    <p> 8.5 In some circumstances you have the right to the erasure of your personal data without undue
                        delay. Those circumstances include: the personal data are no longer necessary in relation to the
                        purposes for which they were collected or otherwise processed; you withdraw consent to
                        consent-based processing; you object to the processing under certain rules of applicable data
                        protection law; the processing is for direct marketing purposes; and the personal data have been
                        unlawfully processed. However, there are exclusions of the right to erasure. The general
                        exclusions include where processing is necessary: for exercising the right of freedom of
                        expression and information; for compliance with a legal obligation; or for the establishment,
                        exercise or defence of legal claims.</p>
                    <p>8.6 In some circumstances you have the right to restrict the processing of your personal data.
                        Those circumstances are: you contest the accuracy of the personal data; processing is unlawful
                        but you oppose erasure; we no longer need the personal data for the purposes of our processing,
                        but you require personal data for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims; and
                        you have objected to processing, pending the verification of that objection. Where processing
                        has been restricted on this basis, we may continue to store your personal data. However, we will
                        only otherwise process it: with your consent; for the establishment, exercise or defence of
                        legal claims; for the protection of the rights of another natural or legal person; or for
                        reasons of important public interest.</p>
                    <p>8.7 You have the right to object to our processing of your personal data on grounds relating to
                        your particular situation, but only to the extent that the legal basis for the processing is
                        that the processing is necessary for: the performance of a task carried out in the public
                        interest or in the exercise of any official authority vested in us; or the purposes of the
                        legitimate interests pursued by us or by a third party. If you make such an objection, we will
                        cease to process the personal information unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate
                        grounds for the processing which override your interests, rights and freedoms, or the processing
                        is for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.</p>
                    <p>8.8 You have the right to object to our processing of your personal data for direct marketing
                        purposes (including profiling for direct marketing purposes). If you make such an objection, we
                        will cease to process your personal data for this purpose.</p>
                    <p>8.9 You have the right to object to our processing of your personal data for scientific or
                        historical research purposes or statistical purposes on grounds relating to your particular
                        situation unless the processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out for
                        reasons of public interest.</p>
                    <p>8.10 To the extent that the legal basis for our processing of your personal data is:<br>(a)
                        consent; or<br>(b) that the processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which
                        you are party or in order to take steps at your request prior to entering into a contract, and
                        such processing is carried out by automated means, you have the right to receive your personal
                        data from us in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format. However, this right
                        does not apply where it would adversely affect the rights and freedoms of others.</p>
                    <p>8.11 If you consider that our processing of your personal information infringes data protection
                        laws, you have a legal right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority responsible for
                        data protection. You may do so in the<br>EU member state of your habitual residence, your place
                        of work or the place of the alleged infringement.</p>
                    <p>8.12 To the extent that the legal basis for our processing of your personal information is
                        consent, you have the right to withdraw that consent at any time. Withdrawal will not affect the
                        lawfulness of processing before the<br>withdrawal.</p>
                    <p>8.13 You may exercise any of your rights in relation to your personal data [ by written notice to
                        us. ]</p>
